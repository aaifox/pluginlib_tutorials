# The class tag declares a plugin that we want to export from our library
# -type: The fully qualified type of the plugin.
# -base_class: The fully qualified base class type for the plugin.
# -description: A description of the plugin and what it does.
# -name (not used in the example above): This refers to the name of the plugin that we're exported given as plugin_namespace/PluginName. Since we used the package name as the namespace for our regular_triangle plugin... this results in us using pluginlib_tutorials_/regular_triangle. After the API change, this attribute is no longer required.
